A Python implementation of the public-key encryption scheme introduced in:

> Rohit Chatterjee, Changrui Mu, Prashant Nalini Vasudevan  
> IACR ePrint 2025/1833 · https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1833

This is the **first public implementation** of this scheme.

## What is this?

The MinRank problem asks: given `k` matrices `A_1, ..., A_k` over GF(2) and a target matrix `Y`, find a binary vector `s` such that `Y - sum_i s_i * A_i` has rank at most `r`.

This scheme builds a PKE from the average-case hardness of that problem, using:
- A **blockwise inner product** (Definition 3.7 in the paper) as the core algebraic tool
- A **duality reduction** showing the dual MinRank problem is as hard as the primal
- An Alekhnovich-style construction adapted to the rank metric

All arithmetic is over `n x n` matrices over GF(2).

## Scheme (Figure 1 of the paper)

**Parameters:** `n`, `k`, `r`, `t` where `t` divides `n`, `r^2 < t - log(n)`, and `(n/t)^2 - 2k - 1 > 0`

**KeyGen:**
1. Sample a random binary vector `s` of length `k`
2. Sample `k` random `n x n` matrices `A_1, ..., A_k` over GF(2)
3. Sample a random `n x n` matrix `E` over GF(2) with `rank(E) <= r`
4. Set `sk = s` and `pk = (A, Y)` where `Y = A(s) + E`

> `A(s)` denotes the linear combination `s_1*A_1 + ... + s_k*A_k` over GF(2).

**Encrypt** bit `x` in `{0, 1}`:
- If `x = 0`: sample a random `n x n` matrix `R` with `rank(R) <= r`, output `ct = <R, (A_1,...,A_k, Y)>_t`
- If `x = 1`: output `ct = (V_1, ..., V_{k+1})` where each `V_i` is a uniformly random `t x t` matrix over GF(2)

**Decrypt** ciphertext `ct = (C_1, ..., C_k, C_{k+1})` with secret key `s`:
1. Compute `M = C_{k+1} - sum_{i=1}^{k} s_i * C_i` over GF(2)
2. If `rank(M) < t - log(n)^(2/3)`, output `0`; otherwise output `1`

**Blockwise inner product** `<A, B>_t`: a `t x t` matrix whose `(i,j)`-th entry is the Frobenius inner product (sum of entrywise products mod 2) of the `(i,j)`-th `(n/t) x (n/t)` block of `A` with the corresponding block of `B`.

**Why it works:**
- When `x = 0`: `M = <R, E>_t`, so `rank(M) <= r^2 < t - log(n)` by Claim 3.15 of the paper — decrypts to `0` correctly.
- When `x = 1`: `M` is a random `t x t` matrix, which has full rank with overwhelming probability — decrypts to `1` correctly.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/minrank-pke
cd minrank-pke
pip install numpy
```

**Requirements:** Python >= 3.11, NumPy.

---

## Quick Start

```python
from minrank_pke import MinRankPKE, Params

params = Params.toy()
scheme = MinRankPKE(params)

pk, sk = scheme.keygen()

ct0 = scheme.encrypt(pk, 0)
ct1 = scheme.encrypt(pk, 1)

print(scheme.decrypt(sk, ct0, params.k))  # 0
print(scheme.decrypt(sk, ct1, params.k))  # 1
```

## Parameter Sets

| Name | n | t | k | r | Notes |
|------|---|---|---|---|-------|
| `Params.toy()` | 64 | 16 | 4 | 1 | Functional tests only, no security |
| `Params.small()` | 128 | 32 | 5 | 2 | Demo only, no security |
| `Params.medium()` | 256 | 32 | 10 | 2 | Heuristic security, low — increase n for real use |

For meaningful security follow Section 4 of the paper. Setting 1 from the paper uses `t = O(n^(1/2))`, `k = O(n)`, `r = O(n^(1/4))`, giving best known attack cost around `2^O(n^(1/4))`.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

All 27 tests pass, covering GF(2) arithmetic, parameter validation, encrypt/decrypt correctness, and the core algebraic identity `M = <R, E>_t`.

## Limitations

- Encrypts a **single bit** per ciphertext, as in the paper's construction.
- Research implementation — not audited, not constant-time, not production-ready.
- For real security, `n` needs to be substantially larger than the demo parameter sets.
